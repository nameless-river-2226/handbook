Our collective is being build under the advice of mentors in different fields who help us adopt the practices, technologies and processes which allow us best serve our mission. These include:

- [the Enspiral network](http://enspiral.com)
- [Enspiral DevÂ Academy](https://www.devacademy.co.nz/)
- [5xRuby](http://5xruby.com/)

## Why put this on Github?

While the contents of this handbook is not on an open-source license, we believe that releasing data beyond software code to the commons can contribute to improving the way communities collaborate on forming and replicating organizational structures with innovative forms of governance.
